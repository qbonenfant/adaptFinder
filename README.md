# adaptFinder
*name will probably change soon*

This is a tool designed to infer the sequences of [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/) adaptaters using approximate kmer count.
In the case the sequences of the adapter is unknown, and not present in the Porechop adapter list, they can be hard to remove.
My goal here is to provide a simple tool able to infer the adapter sequence using kmer counting.

Since adapter are short sequence at the ends of the read, the kmer composing them should be extremely frequent in those area.
That's why we count kmers allowing an edit distance up to 2 between the ressearched kmer and an indexed sample of the reads.

A simple assembly method can then be used to reconstruct the potential adapter.




## Requirement
- C++ (11+)
- SeqAn (2.4.0+)
- networkx

## Compiling
In order to compile this file, I recommend using the following command
~~~
g++ -std=c++14 -fopenmp  -O3 -DNDEBUG -march=native  -mtune=native  adaptFinder.cpp -lrt -o adaptFinder
~~~
